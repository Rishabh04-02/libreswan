# This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
# communication should be encrypted when possible, but will fallback
# to in the clear otherwise.
#
# This is enforced (and can be tweaked) by setting the failureshunt=
# to passthrough.
#
# One IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR per line, optionally specifying a further
# narrowing of protocol, source port and destination port
#
# examples:
# prefer to encrypt all traffic to an IPv4 or IPv6 host or subnet
# 10.0.1.0/24
# 10.1.1.1/32
# 2a03:6000:1004:1::/64
#
# prefer to encrypt all smtp traffic to some host
#  10.0.1.0/24  tcp  0  25
# prefer encrypt all incoming smtp traffic
#  0.0.0.0/0  tcp  25  0
#
# The libreswan letsenccrypt test server - this can be left enabled at all times
193.110.157.131/32
# Attempt OE IPsec using letsencrypt for the entire Internet - Comment out to disable
0.0.0.0/0
